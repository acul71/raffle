A raffle game

This project is based on raffle full-stack-project of Patrick Collins (ChainLink)  
In full-stack-project dir you can find the solidity contracts  
In nextjs-full-stack dir you can find the UI

Right now is just a basic raffle game.  
A raffle is a gambling competition in which people obtain numbered tickets, each of which has the chance of winning a prize. At a set time, the winners are drawn at random from a container holding a copy of each number. The drawn tickets are checked against a collection of prizes with numbers attached to them, and the holder of the ticket wins the prize.  

Connecting with metamask (wallet) players can buy a ticket and wait for the random selection to win the prize (the prize is the sum of all coins collected with tickets)  

I'm going to add some features like to be able to buy more tickets at once, and a better UI  
Stay tuned.....ðŸš§ðŸ‘·
